          <p class="welcome-huge-writing" id="Greetings">Hi,</p>
          <p>I am Marcin Kimak, soon to be a great web developer. I am based in Chicago but I origin from Poland – the homeland of truly tasteful pierogi!</p>
          <p>Currently, I am CCTV technician with superpowers of an electrician by day and a coder by night, but I am on my way to change my career and become an awesome web developer. Please take a look at my website and my works.</p>
          <hr class="hr-small">
          <h2 id="About-me">About</h2>
          <p>I came to the USA four years ago. Before that, I was a pretty good electrician in Poland (there is a magic happening when you make all those bulbs glow) but from the very beginning when I moved to Chicago I knew that one day I will become a web developer. That was my plan and also a dream – and it is hard to find a better place to make your dreams come true than America, right?</p>
          <p>In my free time, I let my artistic side possess me and create some art. I am focused on photography and graphic designs. You can see some of my works in my portfolio on Behance.</p>
          <p>Whenever I look for an inspiration I find it in one of these places:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://cargocollective.com/designchapel" target="_blank">designchapel</a>
            <li><a href="https://www.behance.net/" target="_blank">Behance.net</a>
            <li><a href="youtube.com" target="_blank">youtube.com</a>
          </ul>
          <p>Things that boost my creativity (not necessarily in that order):</p>
          <ol>
            <li>a sip of a coffee
            <li>listening to music
            <li>strolling along
            <li>adding a pinch of chaos to the daily boredom
          </ol>
          <hr class="hr-small">
