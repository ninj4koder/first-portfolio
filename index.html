          <p class="welcome-huge-writing">Hi,</p>
          <p>I am Marcin Kimak, soon to be a great web developer. I’m based in Chicago but I origin from Poland – the homeland of truly tasteful pierogi!</p>
          <p>Currently, I am CCTV technician with superpowers of an electrician by day and a coder by night, but I am on my way to change my career and become an awesome web developer. Please take a look at my website and my works.</p>
          <h2>About me</h2>
          <p>I came to the USA four years ago. Before that, I was a pretty good electrician in Poland (there is a magic happening when you make all those bulbs glow) but from the very beginning when I moved to Chicago I knew that one day I will become a web developer. That was my plan and also a dream – and it is hard to find a better place to make your dreams come true than America, right?</p>
          <p>In my free time, I let my artistic side possess me and create some art. I am focused on photography and graphic designs. You can see some of my works in my portfolio on Behance. Fan of rock music!</p>
